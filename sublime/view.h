@short View - the wrapper to the widget that knows about its document

Views are the convenient way to manage a widget. It is specifically designed to be
light and fast. Use @ref Document::createView() to get the new view for the document
and call @ref View::widget() to create and get the actual widget.

It is not possible to create a view by hand. You need either subclass it or use a Document.

If you create a subclass of View you need to override Sublime::View::createWidget to
provide a custom widget for your view.
